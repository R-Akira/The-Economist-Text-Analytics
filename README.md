# The-Economist-Text-Analytics
A Text Analytics Project that Analyzes Current Happenings

In a world full of uncertainties, patterns are elusive. However, it is interesting whether or not, by seeing it on an aggregate level,  a pattern can be seen.

This project is done by applying concepts from text analytics frameworks (sentimental analysis, wordcloud, correlogram, n-grams)
